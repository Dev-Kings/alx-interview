# 0x06. Star Wars API

## Description
This project involves creating a script in JavaScript that interacts with the Star Wars API to retrieve and display information about Star Wars characters based on a given movie ID. This is a foundational project in learning how to handle APIs, manage asynchronous code, and work with data from external sources using JavaScript.

### HTTP Requests in JavaScript
Learn how to make HTTP requests to external services. You can use libraries like the `request` module or modern alternatives such as `fetch` in Node.js.

### Working with APIs
Gain an understanding of RESTful APIs, interacting with endpoints, and parsing JSON data returned by APIs.

- **Resource**: [Working with APIs in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction)

### Asynchronous Programming
Understand how to handle asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and the async/await syntax, allowing you to manage API response data efficiently.

- **Resource**: [Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous)

### Command Line Arguments in Node.js
Learn how to access command-line arguments provided to a Node.js script using the `process.argv` array.

- **Resource**: [How to Parse Command Line Arguments in Node.js](https://tecadmin.net/how-to-parse-command-line-arguments-in-nodejs/)

### Array Manipulation and Iteration
Master iterating over arrays and manipulating data to format and display Star Wars character names retrieved from the API.

- **Resource**: [JavaScript Array Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

## Usage
The script will take a movie ID as a command-line argument and output the names of characters in the movie. By familiarizing yourself with the above concepts, youâ€™ll be equipped to implement this functionality and demonstrate proficiency in working with APIs and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Example
```bash
$ node starwars_characters.js <movie_id>
