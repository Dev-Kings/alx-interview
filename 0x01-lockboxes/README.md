# 0x01. Lockboxes

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. The problem can be approached using various algorithmic techniques, which will be discussed below.

## Concepts Needed

### 1. Lists and List Manipulation
- **Description:** Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
- **Resource:** [Python Lists (Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

### 2. Graph Theory Basics
- **Description:** Knowledge of graph theory, especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
- **Resource:** [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces/linear-transformations/v/intro-to-graph-theory)

### 3. Algorithmic Complexity
- **Description:** Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important for writing efficient algorithms.
- **Resource:** [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-1-asymptotic-analysis/)

### 4. Recursion
- **Description:** Some solutions may require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
- **Resource:** [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)

### 5. Queue and Stack
- **Description:** Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing BFS or DFS algorithms to traverse through the keys and boxes.
- **Resource:** [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-in-python/)

### 6. Set Operations
- **Description:** Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
- **Resource:** [Python Sets (Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)
