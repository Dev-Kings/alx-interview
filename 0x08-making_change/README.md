# 0x08. Making Change

## Algorithm | Python

### Project Overview
This project focuses on solving the **coin change problem**, a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. The objective is to determine the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations.

This project challenges you to devise a solution that is both **correct** and **efficient** by leveraging key algorithmic concepts.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Greedy Algorithms
- Understanding how greedy algorithms work and why they can be suitable for the coin change problem.
- Recognizing the limitations of greedy algorithms in certain scenarios where they may not yield the optimal solution.

#### 2. Dynamic Programming
- Applying the principles of dynamic programming to solve optimization problems.
- Leveraging overlapping subproblems and the optimal substructure property of the coin change problem.

#### 3. Algorithmic Complexity
- Analyzing time and space complexity.
- Striving for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.

#### 4. Problem-Solving Strategies
- Breaking the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
- Comparing iterative and recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

#### 5. Python Programming
- Using list comprehensions and efficient manipulation of lists.
- Implementing functions with optimal looping and conditional statements.

### Requirements

#### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files must be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.4.3).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files must be exactly:
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  ```
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder is **mandatory**.
- Code must follow the **PEP 8** style (version 1.7.x).
- All files must be executable.

### Additional Resources
- **Mock Technical Interview**: Practice applying these concepts in real-world scenarios.

### Summary
By thoroughly understanding the key concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be well-prepared to tackle the coin change problem. The main challenge lies in deciding whether a **greedy algorithm** suffices or if a **dynamic programming** approach is necessary to ensure correctness and efficiency.

This project tests not only your algorithmic skills but also your ability to choose the right strategy based on problem constraints.
