# 0x09. Island Perimeter

## Overview
This project focuses on solving a geometric problem within a grid context using Python. The goal is to calculate the **perimeter of a single island** in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. The problem tests your ability to navigate and analyze 2D arrays, apply logical operations, and write clean and efficient code.

## Key Concepts

### 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
- Navigating through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

### Conditional Logic
- Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

### Counting Techniques
- Developing a method to count edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks:
  - Identifying land cells.
  - Calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

### Python Programming
- Using nested loops to iterate over grid cells.
- Applying conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
