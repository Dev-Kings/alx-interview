# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing an **in-place algorithm** to rotate an `n x n` 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The primary goal is to modify the matrix directly without using additional memory, ensuring minimal space complexity. 

This challenge tests your understanding of matrix manipulation, in-place operations, and algorithmic problem-solving in Python.

## Concepts Required

### Matrix Representation in Python
- Representing 2D matrices using **lists of lists** in Python.
- Accessing and modifying elements within a 2D matrix.

### In-place Operations
- Performing transformations directly on the data structure.
- Minimizing space complexity by avoiding the creation of matrix copies.

### Matrix Transposition
- Swapping rows and columns of a matrix.
- Implementing transposition as a step in the matrix rotation process.

### Reversing Rows
- Reversing the order of elements in each row to complete the rotation.

### Nested Loops
- Iterating through 2D structures using nested loops.
- Modifying matrix elements in-place during iteration.

## Steps to Rotate a 2D Matrix
1. **Transpose the Matrix**:
   - Swap the rows and columns of the matrix.
   - For a given element `matrix[i][j]`, set it to `matrix[j][i]`.

2. **Reverse Each Row**:
   - After transposition, reverse the elements in every row of the matrix.
   - This completes the 90-degree clockwise rotation.
