# 0x05. N Queens

## Project Overview
The “0x05. N Queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place `N` non-attacking queens on an `N×N` chessboard. 

The goal of this project is to implement a solution that efficiently solves the N queens problem using the backtracking algorithm. It tests ability to apply recursion, list manipulations, and algorithmic thinking in Python.

## Concepts Needed

### 1. **Backtracking Algorithms**
   - **Description:** Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
   - **Resource:** [Backtracking Introduction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-backtracking-2/)

### 2. **Recursion**
   - **Description:** Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
   - **Resource:** [Recursion in Python](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)

### 3. **List Manipulations in Python**
   - **Description:** Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
   - **Resource:** [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

### 4. **Python Command Line Arguments**
   - **Description:** Handling command-line arguments with the `sys` module.
   - **Resource:** [Command Line Arguments in Python](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/sys.html#sys.argv)

## Project Description
The project requires solving the N queens problem using backtracking. It invlolves implement an algorithm that places `N` queens on an `N×N` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Key Requirements:
- Using the backtracking algorithm to explore all possible positions for the queens on the board.
- The solution is implemented in Python and handles inputs via command-line arguments.
- Solution outputs a list of lists, where each list represents a valid solution for placing queens on the board.

## Resources
- Backtracking and recursion for solving combinatorial problems.
- Manipulating and using lists in Python.
- Handling command-line arguments using the `sys` module.

## Goal
The objective of this project is to:
1. Understand and apply the backtracking algorithm to solve the N queens problem.
2. Practice recursion and list manipulations in Python.
3. Gain experience with handling command-line arguments in Python scripts.
