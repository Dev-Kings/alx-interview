# 0x0A. Prime Game

## Algorithm | Python

### Project Overview
This project focuses on solving a competitive game scenario by leveraging understanding of:
- Prime numbers
- Game theory
- Algorithm optimization

The challenge involves determining the winner of a game where players strategically remove prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

### Concepts Needed

#### **Prime Numbers:**
- Understanding what prime numbers are.
- Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

#### **Sieve of Eratosthenes:**
- An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. This can be particularly useful for this task.

#### **Game Theory:**
- Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns.
- Understanding win conditions and strategies for optimal play.

#### **Dynamic Programming / Memoization:**
- Using previous results to make future calculations faster.
- Optimizing solutions for multiple rounds of the game.

#### **Python Programming:**
- Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
- Arrays and lists for storing integers and tracking removed numbers.
